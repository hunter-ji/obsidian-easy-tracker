Easy Tracker lets you record small wins inside any Obsidian note. Use it as a light-weight habit log, mood tracker, or progress journal without leaving your daily pages.

## Highlights
- Check in with a single click using the ready-made button block.
- Review your streak, status, and gaps in the daily overview panel.
- See your annual progress with a calendar-style heatmap.
- Keep your goal front and center with a simple goal card.
- Track in English or Simplified Chinese, and choose whether weeks start on Sunday or Monday.

## Quick Start
1. Install the plugin and enable **Easy Tracker** in **Settings → Community plugins**.
2. Open a note where you want to collect check-ins.
3. Run the command palette and choose one of the insert commands, such as `Insert Check-in Component`.
4. A set of tracker blocks appears in your note; switch to Edit mode to see the buttons.
5. Tap a button to log today’s effort. The plugin writes a line like `* 2025-10-15 - 2` to the note.

## Blocks You Can Insert
- **Daily overview** shows whether you checked in today, your current streak, and the last day you missed.
- **Year calendar heatmap** paints a color-coded grid of your entries for the current year.
- **Check-in buttons** provide one-click options; edit the label or value by changing the text inside the fenced block.
- **My goal** keeps a short motivational message visible.

Use the bundled commands to insert each block separately or together:
- `Insert Check-in Component` adds the overview, heatmap, button group, and goal card.
- `Insert Single Check-in Component` adds a single button alongside the overview and heatmap.
- `Insert Calendar Heatmap`, `Insert Daily Overview`, and `Insert My Goal` drop in each piece on its own.

## Daily Flow
1. Collect your tracker blocks in a note (daily, weekly, or a dedicated dashboard).
2. Each day, press the button that matches your effort level.
3. Glance at the daily overview to keep your streak alive.
4. Scroll through the heatmap whenever you need a big-picture boost.

## Customize Your Experience
- Edit the lines inside the button block to change the labels or the numbers that get logged.
- Move the goal card anywhere in the note and rewrite the message to suit your focus.
- Open **Settings → Easy Tracker** to switch languages or adjust the week start used by the heatmap.

Everything lives in plain text inside your vault, so you can rearrange, search, or sync it just like the rest of your notes.
